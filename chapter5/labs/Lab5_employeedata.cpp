The following employees in a company are up for a special pay increase. 
You are given a file, say EmployeeData.txt, with the following data:

Miller Andrew 65789.87 5
Green Sheila 75892.56 6
Sethi Amit 74900.50 6.1
Alex Hooks 66345.45 7.2
Maria Miller 75345.50 6.7
Marga Harrison 80450.95 5.5

Each input line consists of an employeeâ€™s last name, first name, current salary, 
and percent pay increase. For example, in the first input line, the last name of 
the employee is Miller, the first name is Andrew, the current salary is 65789.87, 
and the pay increase is 5%. Write a program that reads data from the specified file 
and stores the output in the file EmployeeOutput.dat. If the percent pay increase 
is greater than or equal to 6%, then add $1000.00 to the updated salary. For each 
employee, the data must be output in the following form: 

firstName lastName updatedSalary. 

Format the output of decimal numbers to two decimal places. Make sure you use a 
while loop to read until EOF. Your program should work if I change the number of 
lines in the input file.
